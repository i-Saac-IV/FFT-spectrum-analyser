# FFT Spectrum Analyser
I was unhappy with some of VU meters out there, so decided to make my own.

## Hardware and setup
Here is a very vague list of things you'll need to recreate this:
- [Raspberry Pi Pico]([url](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
- FastLED compatable matrix (something like [this]([url](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2547)https://www.adafruit.com/product/2547))
- Some common components to deal with the audio signal **and/or** a microphone (ideally [this one]([url](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1713)https://www.adafruit.com/product/1713) but [this one]([url](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063)https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063) also works)
- Access to a 3d printer for the frame
- Access to a laser cutter for the interlocking grid (or a lot of spare time and a craft knife)
